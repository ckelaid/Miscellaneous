This is a repository for various scripts I write, the function is yet undetermined.

### MT_coins.py 
  - Monte Carlo simulation of three biased coins - A, B, C - with the respective probabilites of being heads (0.6, 0.3, 0.1). The goal of the simulation is to print out the probability of
  a coin landing on heads when flipped, after landing on heads the first time.
